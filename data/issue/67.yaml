issueDescription: ! 'The issuebody is just one line. Make it more then one line \n
  That would be great!

  So does it work??

  It should keep the newlines!


  How should the issue body be implemented? Does pandoc have a specific format?


  It should have checklists like that:

  [X] implement parser

  [ ] figure out issue body format

  [ ] shave yak
